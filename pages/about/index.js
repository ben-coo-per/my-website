              I design, build, and break with the intention of improving the way
              we interact with our world and each other.

              <br />
              I went to school for chemical engineering but learned I was more
              suited to product development. <br />
              <br />
              After graduation, I began working at Accenture and gained
              experience running development teams & managing a product. <br />
              <br />
              I am now working on a start up aimed at making interacting with
              local politicians easy, inclusive, and impactful.
              <br />
              <br />I like watching movies when it rains and riding my bike when
              it doesnâ€™t.
